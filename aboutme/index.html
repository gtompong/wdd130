    <h2>Glenn Tompong</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Glenn and I live in the Philippines. I have a 3-year Diploma in Information Technology and I want to earn a bachelor’s degree to have a better job and career. I love to play volleyball, basketball and mobile games. My wife and I got married in the Philippines Manila Temple in April 2014 and we currently have two wonderful children, Gazelem Dale (6) and Ashley Paige (7 months).</p>
    <p>I am currently working as lead in the IT Service Management team. I want to switch my career in software development, that's why I am so excited to take this course! I am pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Technology at BYU-Idaho. I am thankful that BYU Pathway is now available in our time and our location, which provides a quality education at an affordable cost. I am also thankful to dedicated teachers that will help us. I want to work as a full-stack web developer and I am excited to learn best practices in web design.</p>
    <p>I am a child of record in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was baptized when I turned 8 years old, and our family was sealed in the Philippines Manila Temple in December 1990. I served in a full-time mission at Philippines Cagayan De Oro Mission. My favorite scripture verse that always uplifts me is from Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
